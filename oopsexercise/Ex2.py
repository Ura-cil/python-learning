# OOP Exercise 3: Create a child class Bus that will inherit all of the variables and methods of the Vehicle class

class vehicle:
    def __init__(self,name , speed , mileage):
        self.name = name 
        self.speed =speed
        self.mileage = mileage
a = vehicle("uracil",150,50)  
print(a.name,a.speed,a.mileage)
