# Exercise 4: Update the first set with items that don’t exist in the second set
# Given two Python sets, write a Python program to update the first set with items that exist only in the first set and not in the second set.

# Given:

# set1 = {10, 20, 30}
# set2 = {20, 40, 50}
# Expected output:

# set1 {10, 30}


set1 = {10, 20, 30}
set2 = {20, 40, 50}

set1.difference_update(set2)
print(set1)
